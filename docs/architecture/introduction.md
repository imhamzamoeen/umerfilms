# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for UmerFilms Portfolio, including frontend implementation, API routes, and deployment infrastructure. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This is a JAMstack architecture optimized for a video-first portfolio website. The design prioritizes performance (video delivery), developer experience (Next.js App Router), and simplicity (no database for MVP).

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Status:** Existing Next.js 15 project (already initialized)

The project was bootstrapped with `create-next-app` and includes:
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- TypeScript configured
- Tailwind CSS configured
- ESLint configured

**Constraints from existing setup:**
- Must use App Router (not Pages Router)
- TypeScript strict mode expected
- Tailwind for styling (no CSS-in-JS)
