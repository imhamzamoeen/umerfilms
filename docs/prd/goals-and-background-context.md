# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Establish a professional, memorable online presence that differentiates Umer from competitors
- Convert portfolio visitors into client inquiries through clear CTAs and easy contact
- Showcase Umer's unique personality and humor alongside technical videography/photography skills
- Create a video-first experience that aligns with Umer's medium and strengths
- Deliver a fast, responsive portfolio that works seamlessly across all devices
- Provide a foundation for future expansion (mood filtering, BTS content, testimonials)

## Background Context

The videography/photography market is saturated with talented creators using generic, template-based portfolios that fail to communicate personality or differentiate their work. Umer's competitive advantage lies in his unique perspective, technical craft (slow-motion, distinctive angles), and authentic humor - qualities that cannot be conveyed through static image grids and boilerplate "About Me" text.

This portfolio solves the differentiation problem by adopting a video-first, personality-forward approach. With Umer's social media presence growing, the portfolio serves as a professional hub where brands, agencies, and followers can quickly assess his style, understand his personality, and take action (request a quote). The MVP focuses on three core experiences: an impactful hero showreel, a video-based About page, and a clear "Work With Me" section with contact form.
