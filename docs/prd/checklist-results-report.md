## High Priority Items for Architect

- **Video optimization strategy** - Self-hosted video is a technical risk; architect should validate approach and define compression/delivery strategy

## Recommendations

1. Proceed to Architecture - PRD is ready; no blockers identified
2. Architect should focus on video delivery strategy and Resend integration
3. Consider Story 2.2 hover video preview as optional if timeline pressure emerges
4. Have fallback plan for video hosting if self-hosted proves problematic

## Final Decision

**READY FOR ARCHITECT** - The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design.
