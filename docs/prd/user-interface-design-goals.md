# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

A cinematic, immersive portfolio experience that feels like watching a film trailer rather than browsing a website. The design should be dark, moody, and video-forward - letting Umer's work speak first while his personality shines through subtle copy and the video About page. The experience should feel premium yet approachable, professional yet fun - matching Umer's brand of "skilled but not arrogant, funny but not goofy."

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Video-First Browsing:** Videos are the primary content; images serve as thumbnails/previews only
- **Minimal Clicks to Action:** Max 3 clicks from landing to contact form submission
- **Scroll-Driven Discovery:** Homepage guides users through showreel → featured work → CTA naturally
- **Hover-to-Preview:** Portfolio grid items show video preview on hover (desktop)
- **Tap-to-Play:** Mobile users tap thumbnails to enter full video view
- **Sticky Navigation:** Persistent nav for easy access to key sections
- **Smooth Transitions:** Subtle fade/slide animations matching cinematic feel (not distracting)

## Core Screens and Views

| Screen | Purpose | Key Elements |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Home** | First impression & hook | Hero showreel, brief intro, featured work preview, CTA |
| **Work/Portfolio** | Showcase projects | Grid of project thumbnails, category filter, video playback |
| **Project Detail** | Deep dive on single project | Full video, project description, category, related work |
| **About** | Personality & connection | Video introduction, text bio, skills/gear (optional) |
| **Work With Me** | Conversion & contact | Services list, "Get Quote" CTA, contact form |

## Accessibility

**Target: WCAG AA Compliance**

- Sufficient color contrast (especially important with dark theme)
- Keyboard navigation support
- Video captions available (for About video at minimum)
- Alt text for all images
- Focus indicators visible
- Screen reader compatible navigation

## Branding

**Status:** No existing brand assets - visual identity to be created

| Element | Direction |
|---------|-----------|
| **Color Palette** | Dark/moody base (deep blacks, charcoals) with accent color TBD |
| **Typography** | Modern, clean sans-serif; possibly cinematic display font for headers |
| **Visual Style** | Cinematic, editorial, premium feel |
| **Tone** | Professional but approachable, hints of humor in microcopy |
| **Imagery** | Video-dominant; high contrast, dramatic lighting aesthetic |

## Target Devices and Platforms

**Web Responsive** - optimized for:

| Device | Considerations |
|--------|----------------|
| **Mobile (Primary)** | Touch interactions, vertical video consideration, performance-critical |
| **Tablet** | Hybrid touch/hover, landscape/portrait support |
| **Desktop** | Hover states, larger video playback, multi-column layouts |

**Browser Support:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (last 2 versions)
