## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Hero Showreel with Voice/Humor
- Rationale: First impression determines if visitors stay or leave; this hooks them instantly
- Next steps:
  1. Select 5-7 best video clips (variety of styles)
  2. Write/record Umer's intro voiceover with humor
  3. Edit into punchy 10-second showreel
- Resources needed: Video editing software, best footage compilation, audio recording
- Timeline: First priority before launch

#### #2 Priority: Video About Page
- Rationale: Converts the "About" page from boring to memorable; showcases personality
- Next steps:
  1. Script casual, humorous introduction
  2. Film Umer speaking naturally (not overly polished)
  3. Keep it under 60-90 seconds
- Resources needed: Camera setup, natural lighting, simple background
- Timeline: Second priority, can launch with basic version

#### #3 Priority: Work With Me Section
- Rationale: Without clear CTA and offerings, visitors can't convert to clients
- Next steps:
  1. Define 2-3 service packages
  2. Decide on pricing display (ranges, "starting at", or "contact for quote")
  3. Create simple contact form
- Resources needed: Service definitions, pricing strategy decision
- Timeline: Must have for launch
